# transforms-3d-robotics
A wrapper for the transforms-3d python library that I use for personal and research projects. This uses numpy and removes some of the complications of generalized transforms (e.g skews) and contains a variety of helper functions

This was developed with contributions from Kevin Gilboy. 

Recognition is given to  Matthew Brett and Christoph Gohlke who developed the transforms3d package.

Consider this to still be under active development and open for use as-is. I am happy to chat about improvements, etc.
